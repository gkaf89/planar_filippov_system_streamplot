abstract = {Z-source converter configurations make it possible to overcome intrinsic limits present in conventional ac-dc and dc-ac converters. A typical three-phase inverter cannot supply output voltages greater than the voltages at its input; in the same manner, a typical three-phase boost rectifier cannot supply output voltages lower than input voltages. Using Z-source topology permits overcoming both these limits. In fact, a Z-source boost rectifier can theoretically either step-up or step-down the output voltage to any desired value starting from the conventional three-phase diode bridge rectifier output voltage level. In addition, it presents intrinsic immunity to shoot-through states, resulting in improved reliability of the entire system. In this study, attention is focused on the mathematical modelling of a three-phase Z-source boost rectifier for power factor correction power supply applications; using such a topology as first-stage converter allows designing the second-stage converters with the same voltage constraints of single-phase units.},

abstract = {It is well known that there exist second-order harmonic current and corresponding ripple voltage on dc bus for single phase PWM rectifiers. The low frequency harmonic current is normally filtered using a bulk capacitor in the bus which results in low power density. This paper studies the energy storage capacitor reduction methods for single phase rectifiers. The minimum ripple energy storage requirement is derived independent of a specific topology. Based on the minimum ripple energy requirement, the feasibility of the active capacitor's reduction schemes is verified. Then, we propose a bidirectional buck-boost converter as our ripple energy storage circuit that can effectively reduce the energy storage capacitance. Simulation and experimental results are provided for verification purposes.},

@article{Shimizu2000a,
abstract = {A novel topology of single-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage-source rectifier capable of achieving not only a sinusoidal input current, but also a zero-ripple output current, is presented. The rectifier consists of a conventional single-phase PWM voltage-source rectifier, a pair of additional switches and an inductor. Hence, the proposed rectifier requires neither a large DC capacitor nor a passive L-C resonant circuit. The input current control is achieved by the conventional PWM current control technique. However, DC ripple current reduction control is difficult because one of the switching legs in the DC ripple current reduction circuit is shared with the PWM rectifier circuit. Two control methods, referred to here as the DC C inductor method and the AC inductor method, are proposed for DC ripple reduction, and the characteristics of these control methods are discussed. These control methods are implemented using a microprocessor, and the effectiveness of the circuit is confirmed experimentally. This rectifier has useful applications in uninterruptible power systems and DC power supplies, especially for cases in which the batteries are connected in parallel to the DC line},

@article{Loh2005,
abstract = {Z-Source inverters have recently been proposed as an alternative power conversion concept as they have both voltage buck and boost capabilities. These inverters use a unique impedance network, coupled between the power source and converter circuit, to provide both voltage buck and boost properties, which cannot be achieved with conventional voltage-source and current-source inverters. To facilitate understanding of Z-source inverter modulation, this paper presents a detailed analysis, showing how various conventional pulse-width modulation strategies can be modified to switch a voltage-type Z-source inverter either continuously or discontinuously, while retaining all the unique harmonic performance features of these conventional modulation strategies. This paper starts by analyzing the modulation requirements of a single-phase H-bridge Z-source inverter, and subsequently extends the analysis to cover the more complex three-phase-leg and four-phase-leg Z-source inverters, with carrier-based implementation reference equations derived for all the inverters. The theoretical and modulation concepts presented have been verified both in simulation and experimentally.},

The use of sliding-mode control on line-commutated power converters implies the use of fixed-frequency sliding-mode design, originating steady-state errors. These are eliminated using a higher order switching function, with fourth-order Bessel polynomial coefficients, to minimize the response time and to eliminate the overshoot in the reaching mode. Comparisons are made using simulations (MATLAB/SIMULINK blocks) and experimental results. The sliding-mode controllers, as well as the PI controllers, need almost the same hardware and present no steady-state errors and no output voltage overshoots. Besides allowing a faster dynamics than the PI controllers, the proposed sliding-mode approach provides a new, nonlinear theoretical frame for solving the control problem of power rectifiers with output filters},

For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space.

abstract = {New topologies for harmonic mitigation and active filters have come a long way, and these address the line-harmonic control at the source. These mitigate some of the disadvantages of passive filters, however, for nonlinear loads above 1 MW the passive filters are an economical choice. This paper discusses two types of filters: band pass filters and damped filters, which are commonly applied. The operation of these filters is described with respect to the design and system limitations. The operating constraints are then superimposed. The development of this approach shows that there are design limitations and large system changes or modifications can result in higher distortion or even damage to filters in extreme cases. The constraints and limitations that a designer faces in implementing an effective filter design with modern tools of harmonic analysis, measurements, and system analysis are discussed. The paper shows that in most distribution systems it is practical and economical to implement passive filter designs, provided the required safeguards are considered.},

In the single-phase grid connected inverter, it is well known that a power pulsation with twice the grid frequency is contained in the input power. In a conventional inverter, electrolytic capacitors with large capacitance have been used in order to smooth the DC voltage. However, lifetime of those capacitors is shortened by the power pulsation with twice grid frequency. The authors have been studied a active power decoupling method that reduce the pulsating power on the input DC bus line, this enables to transfer the ripple energy appeared on the input DC capacitors into the energy in a small film capacitor on the additional circuit. Hence, extension of the lifetime of the inverter can be expected because the small film capacitor substitutes for the large electrolytic capacitors. Finally, simulation and experimental results are discussed.},

The propose model comprises of house clusters with an autonomous communication developed for the residential area, taking the consideration of stochastic behavior of wind and solar irradiation. Voltage droop and Slope compensation peak current mode control technique for the synchronous bidirectional boost converters is employed for the energy storage systems (ESSs). The bidirectional converter stage for house clusters plays a pivotal role in standalone operation. In case a battery pack is laid off from any house cluster, the dc bus voltage still be stabilized due to the proximity bidirectional converter stages of other house clusters or community bank. The houses in the cluster comprise of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), solar photo voltaic (PV), battery bank and variable load. The proposed model is simulated on MATLAB/Simulink environment and suffices the real time environment.},

These drawbacks, including large control authority and control chattering, were remedied by Slotine and Sastry (1983) and Slotine (1984) by replacing control switching at a fixed sliding surface by a smooth control interpolation in a boundary layer neighbouring a time-varying sliding surface. This avoids the excitation of high-frequency unmodelled dynamics, and leads to an explicit trade-off between model uncertainty and controller tracking performance. The present paper examines how to further improve performance by effectively coupling on-line parameter estimation to sliding controller design.

abstract = {This paper proposes the experiments and setups for studying diagnosis and prognosis of electrolytic capacitors in DC-DC power converters. Electrolytic capacitors and power MOS-FET's have higher failure rates than other components in DC-DC converter systems. Currently, our work focuses on experimental analysis and modeling electrolytic capacitors degradation and its effects on the output of DC-DC converter systems. The output degradation is typically measured by the increase in Equivalent series resistance and decrease in capacitance leading to output ripple currents. Typically, the ripple current effects dominate, and they can have adverse effects on downstream components. A model based approach to studying degradation phenomena enables us to combine the physics based modeling of the DC-DC converter with physics of failure models of capacitor degradation, and predict using stochastic simulation methods how system performance deteriorates with time. Degradation experiments were conducted where electrolytic capacitors were subjected to electrical and thermal stress to accelerate the aging of the system. This more systematic analysis may provide a more general and accurate method for computing the remaining useful life (RUL) of the component and the converter system.},

This paper presents a bidirectional half bridge DC/DC converter, featuring a novel sliding-mode controller, input and output short-circuit protection and a wide input voltage operating range. The ability to achieve step-up or step-down voltage conversion and accommodate a wide input voltage variation makes this design particularly useful for interfacing energy storage devices whose voltage varies widely with state of charge such as supercapacitor modules. The control theory and design methodology are described and converter performance is assessed at realistic operating levels by simulation and experiment.

The synthesized protocols are robust against exogenous disturbances on the continuous dynamics and can react to possibly adversarial events (both external and internal). Finite-state approximations that abstract the behavior of the underlying continuous dynamics are defined using finite transition systems. Such approximations allow us to transform the continuous switching synthesis problem into a discrete synthesis problem in the form of a two-player game between the system and the environment, where the winning conditions represent the high-level temporal logic specifications. Restricting to an expressive subclass of LTL formulas, these temporal logic games are amenable to solutions with polynomial-time complexity. By construction, existence of a discrete switching strategy for the discrete synthesis problem guarantees the existence of a switching protocol that can be implemented at the continuous level to ensure the correctness of the nonlinear switched system and to react to the environment at run time.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to continuous variable design optimization of a power electronics converter. The objective of the optimization approach is to minimize the total component cost. The methodology is illustrated with the design of a boost power factor correction front-end converter with an input electromagnetic interference filter. The system design variables are first identified. The relevant system responses and component costs are then expressed as a function of these design variables. Finally, by using mathematical optimization techniques, the design variable values that minimize the total system component cost are obtained, given practical constraints on these design variables and system responses.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new hysteresis current regulation technique with reduced common mode switching for three-phase multilevel inverters. The proposed technique uses three independent multilevel hysteresis current regulators to generate three sets of complementary gating signals through the comparison of the measured current errors with implemented hysteresis limits. These gating signals are then distributed to each complementary switch pair of the multilevel inverter structure to switch with reduced common mode voltage. Additionally, by intelligently compensating for transition delays during dead-times, common mode voltage can essentially be eliminated completely. Two versions of the common mode regulation technique are derived by using either the line currents or differences between the line currents, known as delta currents, as the control variables. A detailed investigation is presented to determine that the delta currents are the optimal control variables. The performance of the proposed strategy is confirmed through both simulation and experimental investigations.},

For timed systems we propose a specification language that refers to time only through age functions which measure the length of the most recent time interval in which a given formula has been continuously true. We then consider hybrid systems, which are systems consisting of a non-trivial mixture of discrete and continuous components, such as a digital controller that controls a continuous environment. The proposed framework extends the temporal logic approach which has proven useful for the formal analysis of discrete systems such as reactive programs. The new framework consists of a semantic model for hybrid time, the notion of phase transition systems, which extends the formalism of discrete transition systems, an extended version of Statecharts for the specification of hybrid behaviors, and an extended version of temporal logic that enables reasoning about continuous change.},

This “just-in-time” switching controller controls the output voltage and the line input currents, while providing bidirectional power flow, near-unity-power-factor operation, low harmonic content, fast dynamic response of the output voltage, and minimum switching frequency due to a new $\alpha$-$\beta$ space-vector current regulator. The voltage controller performance is compared with the behavior of the conventional proportional integral output voltage control, aided by PWM current-mode modulators, and with the nonrobust fast and slow manifold sliding-mode approach. The comparison shows that the proposed controller confers faster dynamics and does not present steady-state errors. Test results confirm that the performance of the controller is independent of system parameters and load and exceeds the performance of existing hysteretic current-mode control systems},

When reversing, the truck and trailer can be modelled as an unstable nonlinear system with state and input saturations. Due to these constraints the system is impossible to globally stabilize with standard smooth control techniques, since some initial states necessarily lead to that the so called jack-knife locks between the truck and the trailer. The proposed hybrid control method, which combines backward and forward motions, provide a global attractor to the desired reference trajectory.

abstract = {In this paper, the real-time operation and the harmonic analysis of isolated and nonisolated dc microgrid are investigated. The microgrid features hybrid energy sources with various loading schemes. This hybrid dc microgrid was supplied by an internal generator and the ac utility grid. A supercapacitor bank functions by acting as a power buffer to satisfy the high power requirements of the dc microgrid. In order to properly manage the energy and prevent the ac grid power pulsation, a current-voltage control technique based on master-slave control concept is proposed. In this technique, the supercapacitor bank operates as the master and controls the dc bus voltage. The other converters are working in current control mode to share the required power. The controllers of the converters are equipped with hysteresis voltage control, which monitors the entire supercapacitor bank. Additionally, an analog hysteresis voltage protection circuit board was designed and implemented to protect the supercapacitor cells from overvoltages that can occur due to uneven charge distribution during the fast charging processes. The protection circuit, which was developed and built here, was experimentally tested, and its error was analyzed. Various operating modes based on different power sharing patterns were defined. The experimental test was carried out for both galvanically isolated and nonisolated dc grid systems. The results show that the proposed energy management algorithm properly shares power and control the voltage. In addition, depending on the power sharing pattern, the isolation of the dc microgrid significantly affects the harmonic content of the current.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of finding a closed-form optimal solution for the energy management problem in charge-sustaining hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and proposes, for the first time, a generalized stability and optimality framework for this type of problem. The energy management problem, which by its very nature is a finite-time horizon control problem, is reformulated as a nonlinear-nonquadratic infinite-time optimization problem, leading to a family of state-feedback control laws that provide optimality with respect to an infinite time horizon performance objective, while guaranteeing asymptotic stability. The stability problem in charge-sustaining HEVs is formulated to allow the design of analytical solutions using a Lyapunov-based argument. The proposed control law is implemented on a pre-transmission parallel hybrid heavy-duty vehicle and the performance of the closed-loop system is shown in simulation and compared with the benchmark solution provided by Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) and the real-time adaptive controller adaptive-PMP. Results show low sensitivity to the control parameter, low-calibration effort, and reduction of computational effort, while maintaining close-to-the-optimum performance. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations were conducted to validate and verify the new strategy in a real-time simulation setup.},

abstract = {Existing circuit topologies for VSC-HVDC power transmission fall into two distinct categories. In the first category, low-pulse-number converters are used, employing large numbers of IGBTs in series in each valve, with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The second category, known as the M2C topology, uses a "Multi-Level" approach to achieve very high pulse numbers. However, recent research work has highlighted a number of interesting possibilities for a new family of converters for use in VSC-HVDC schemes, combining the advantages of both approaches. The new converters rely on using a combination of IGBT valves using series-connected IGBTs and multilevel converters based on individual and isolated half-bridge and full-bridge submodules ("cells") which provide a "wave-shaping" function. Several options are possible, where the multilevel cells are connected in series or parallel with series IGBT "Director" valves and with the multilevel cells on either the AC or DC side of the converter.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is one of the most promising converter topologies for high-voltage applications, especially for high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems. One of the most challenging issues associated with the MMC is the capacitor voltage variations, which if not properly controlled, result in large circulating currents flowing through the converter legs. This paper develops a mathematical model to formulate and analyze capacitor voltage variations and the circulating currents within the MMC legs. Based on the developed model, the limits to the capacitor voltage balancing task are derived and graphically presented. A set of simulation results conducted in MATLAB/Simulink environment are presented to verify the accuracy of the mathematical analysis.},

@article{Tang2015,
abstract = {This letter proposes a novel circuit topology which can realize the power decoupling function without adding additional active switches into the circuit. The dc-link capacitor of a full bridge rectifier is split into two identical parts and the midpoint is connected to one leg through a filter inductor. With such a configuration, this leg can control the current going into the two output capacitors connected in series for power decoupling, and the other leg can control the line current according to active and reactive power requirement. The proposed topology does not require additional passive component, e.g., inductors or film capacitors for ripple energy storage because this task can be accomplished by the dc-link capacitors, and therefore its implementation cost can be minimized. Another unique feature of the proposed topology is that the current stress of power semiconductors can be reduced as compared to other existing active power decoupling circuits. This feature becomes more obvious when the converter operates with capacitive load, e.g., for grid voltage support. The operational principle of the proposed circuit is discussed, and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed circuit concept.},

@article{Gupta2008a,
abstract = {In this paper, the method of triangular carrier switching control of two-level inverters is extended to cascaded multilevel inverters using phase-shifted multicarrier unipolar pulsewidth modulation (PWM). The condition for smooth modulation is obtained using the Bessel's function representation of the PWM output and the switching condition of the multilevel-inverter-controlled system. A method is proposed for the determination of the minimum amplitude of the triangular carrier for smooth modulation at fixed switching frequency. It is shown that the multilevel modulation based on the phase-shifted carriers significantly reduces the ripple magnitude in the switching function and allows the use of a smaller carrier amplitude under closed loop. This increases the forward gain and, hence, improves the tracking characteristics. The proposed cascaded multilevel inverter control is implemented for the operation of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) in the voltage control mode. The experimental verification of the theoretical and simulation results is provided through a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based control of a laboratory model of a single-phase DSTATCOM.},

abstract = {A novel experimentally motivated method in order to design a family of easy-to-implement sliding-mode controllers for power converters is proposed. Two main results are presented. First, the relation between sliding-mode control and average control is reinterpreted so that the limitation of the switching frequency for the closed-loop system is achieved in a more direct way than other methods so far reported in the literature. For this purpose, a class of sliding surfaces which makes the associated equivalent control be the system average control is proposed. Second, the achievement of a constant switching frequency in the controlled system is assured without requiring the sliding-mode-based controller to be modified, unlike most previous works. As a result, the proposed sliding surfaces-type can be directly implemented via a pulse-width modulator. The control methodology is implemented for the voltage control in a boost converter prototype in which the load is considered unknown. Experimental results confirm high performance and robustness under parameters variation. Furthermore, the solution proposed is easy to implement and well-suited for other power converters.},

@article{Kapat2012,
abstract = {The output-voltage-derivative term of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller injects significant noise in a dc-dc converter. This is mainly due to the presence of parasitic resistance and inductance of the output capacitor. Particularly during a large-signal transient, noise injection significantly degrades phase margin. Although noise characteristics can be improved by reducing the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter associated with the voltage derivative, it degrades the closed-loop bandwidth. A new formulation of a PID controller is introduced to replace the output-voltage-derivative with information about the capacitor current, thus reducing noise injection. It is shown this new formulation preserves the fundamental principle of a PID controller and incorporates a load current feed-forward as well as inductor current dynamics. This can be helpful to further improve bandwidth and phase margin. The proposed method is shown to be equivalent to a voltage-mode controlled buck converter and a current-mode controlled boost converter with a PID controller in the voltage feedback loop.},

The Z-source converter employs a unique impedance network (or circuit) to couple the converter main circuit to the power source, thus providing unique features that cannot be obtained in the traditional voltage-source (or voltage-fed) and current-source (or current-fed) converters where a capacitor and inductor are used, respectively. The Z-source converter overcomes the conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations of the traditional voltage-source converter (abbreviated as V-source converter) and current-source converter (abbreviated as I-source converter) and provides a novel power conversion concept. The Z-source concept can be applied to all DC-to-AC, AC-to-DC, AC-to-AC, and DC-to-DC power conversion. To describe the operating principle and control, this paper focuses on an example: a Z-source inverter for DC-AC power conversion needed in fuel cell applications.

In order to control the capacitor power and the grid-side reactive power to be zero, two sliding mode controllers were designed in the inner power loop. To realize the decoupling of grid-side active power, load power and capacitor power, an outer voltage square loop with a PI controller was adopted. This control strategy achieves the goal that the capacitor power can be controlled directly and the effect of load disturbance can be reduced by decoupling of the power of capacitor and load. Simulation results show that the new strategy has a better dynamic performance compared with direct power control based on sliding mode variable structure (SMC-DPC).},

abstract = {In 2003 the Roadmapping Initiative of the European Center of Power Electronics (ECPE) has been started based on a future vision of society in 2020 in order to define the future role of power electronics, and to identify technological barriers and prepare new technologies well in time. In the framework of this initiative a new mathematically supported approach for the roadmapping in power electronics has been developed. As described in this paper the procedure relies on a comprehensive mathematical modeling and subsequent multi-objective optimization of a converter system. The relationship between the technological base and the performance of the system then exists as a mathematical representation, whose optimization assures the best possible exploitation of the available degrees of freedom and technologies. Thus an objective Technology Node of a system is obtained, whereby physical limits are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system performance with regard to the technological base can be calculated directly and the internal interdependence of Performance Indices directly studied. Accordingly, the improvement in performance achievable by improvements in the technology base can be tested and assessed in advance. Moreover, different system concepts, i.e. circuit topologies, control procedures, etc. can be evaluated and directly compared with regard to achievable efficiency, power density and costs in the form of the associated Pareto Front which defines the boundary of the Feasible Performance Space. If the target performance lies outside the Pareto Envelope of known system concepts and state-of-the-art technologies, a new technology must be employed. The necessity of a technological leap, i.e. the introduction of a Disruptive Technology can thus be recognized at an early stage. This offers an excellent basis for effective roadmapping for various main application areas in power electronics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a single-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) system which is primarily free from the double-frequency ripples from which the conventional PLL system suffers. The proposed PLL is then extended to reject the harmonic components from the input signal and to estimate the phase-angle and frequency of the distorted input signal with no error. Three units of the proposed PLL can be used in three-phase power systems, such as FACTS and HVDC converters, to estimate the phase-angles of the individual phases with no double-frequency ripples and without sensitivity to the presence of harmonics and inter-harmonics. This makes the proposed PLL unique and desirable for applications which demand highly accurate estimation of the phase-angle(s) and frequency.},

abstract = {In this study, a non-linear digital control of a boost converter based on a sliding discrete-time approximation is presented. The control strategy follows a classical cascade regulation scheme with the inner loop consisting in a non-linear current-control based on discrete-time sliding mode, and the outer one being composed of a simple discrete-time proportional-integral (PI) controller for output voltage regulation. An analytical expression of the current control law is developed using a simplified discrete-time small-signal model of the boost converter. The discrete-time PI compensator is designed from a discrete-time small-signal parametric model of the inner loop obtained by linearisation around the desired equilibrium point. The proposed method is initially based on the notion of discrete-time sliding motion to eventually derive a pulse width modulation (PWM) controlled system. Thus, the reported approach can be categorised not only as a direct digital design technique for voltage regulation but also as a competitive method to design sliding-mode-based PWM controllers. Simulated and experimental results in a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode verify the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {DC–DC power converters are switched devices whose averaged dynamics are described by a bilinear second-order system with saturated input. In some cases (e.g., boost and buck–boost converters), the input output dynamics can be of nonminimum-phase nature. Current-mode control is the standard strategy for output voltage regulation in high dynamic performance industrial DC–DC power converters. It is basically composed by a saturated linear state feedback (inductor current and output voltage) plus an output voltage integral feedback to remove steady-state offset. Despite its widespread usage, there is a lack of rigorous results to back up its stabilization capability and to systematize its design. In this paper, we prove that current-mode control yields semiglobal stability with asymptotic regulation of the output voltage.},

As a result, this circuit does not require a large DC capacitor or a passive LC resonant circuit. Furthermore, control of the additional switches and PWM rectifier requires only a simple control circuit. The effectiveness of this circuit was confirmed by experiments and analysis.

The hybrid system combines discrete event dynamics with nonlinear continuous dynamics: the discrete event dynamics model linguistic and qualitative information and naturally accommodate mode switching logic, and the continuous dynamics model the physical processes themselves, such as the continuous response of an aircraft to the forces of aileron and throttle. Input variables model both continuous and discrete control and disturbance parameters. We translate safety specifications into restrictions on the system's reachable sets of states. Then, using analysis based on optimal control and game theory for automata and continuous dynamical systems, we derive Hamilton-Jacobi equations whose solutions describe the boundaries of reachable sets. These equations are the heart of our general controller synthesis technique for hybrid systems, in which we calculate feedback control laws for the continuous and discrete variables, which guarantee that the hybrid system remains in the "safe subset" of the reachable set. We discuss issues related to computing solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Throughout, we demonstrate out techniques on examples of hybrid automata modeling aircraft conflict resolution, autopilot flight mode switching, and vehicle collision avoidance.},

abstract = {The recently proposed current-fed quasi- Z-source inverter (QZSI) can buck and boost voltage and provide bidirectional power flow . A crucial criterion for the size of three-phase PWM converters is the cooling of the power semiconductors and thus determination of power dissipation at certain operating points. In the modified space vector PWM method (SVPWM) control method for this circuit, different PWM sequences can lead to different switching loss, current ripple, total harmonic distortion, and also the voltage spike on the switching devices. In order to select the best PWM sequence to obtain the best performance and efficiency, a complete analysis and calculation for the four mentioned criterions are presented for different sequences. For each criterion, the best sequences are selected to obtain better performance. Finally, the optimized PWM sequence in the modified SVPWM control for this circuit is selected with the optimized hardware design together to achieve the best efficiency at the full operation range. The optimized hardware design has been built in the lab, including the optimal design of the coupled inductor, optimal design and selection of Z-source capacitors and output capacitors, the selection of Z-source diode, and the final layout of the hardware. In order to bring the prototype into real application in a hybrid electrical vehicle , the inverter efficiency is measured according to the motor P-V curve. The estimated efficiency curve and experiment results are plot and compared. The best efficiency at 15 kW reaches 97.6{\%} at unity voltage gain.},

The paper describes expert system-aided automated design, simulation and controller tuning of an AC motor drive system. It is an extension of earlier work that discussed the design and optimization of power converter systems. Based on the application and performance specifications from the user, the expert system selects a motor drive configuration consisting of the AC machine type, power converter and control topologies. The expert system embeds the design expertise of an experienced AC motor drive system designer to configure, design and fine-tune the AC motor drive system. Next, the expert system supervises an autonomous hybrid simulation where the controller software is fine-tuned in real-time before loading to an experimental AC motor drive system. The paper discusses the design methodology for AC motor drive systems, with particular emphasis on the configuration selection, AC motor sizing and control design and tuning.

abstract = {Z-source energy conversion is a recent concept introduced for adding voltage-boost functionality to the otherwise buck-only dc-ac inverter. The same concept can equally be extended to other converter topologies including the indirect ac-ac matrix converter, where only a single Z-source impedance network needs to be inserted to its intermediate dc-link. Because of such a simple insertion, topological extension of the indirect Z-source matrix converter is viewed as trivial with its operating states easily deducible from its existing dc-ac counterpart. In contrast, modulation of the extended indirect ac-ac entity is judged as nontrivial and not at all obvious if advantages like buck-boost flexibility, minimum commutation count and ease of implementation are to be attained simultaneously, in addition to sinusoidal input and output quantities commonly set as objectives for ac-ac energy conversion. Attaining these advantages simultaneously is no doubt important since any shortfalls or compromises would make it even harder to justify for those passive components introduced to the otherwise “all semiconductor” indirect matrix converter. Bringing forth these advantages by unveiling related optimal modulation theories is therefore a relevant investigation that is pursued now to better present the indirect Z-source matrix converter as an attractive alternative for ac-ac buck-boost energy conversion. Findings presented here on have already been verified in simulation or experimentally using a laboratory-constructed prototype.},

abstract = {If a set of ordinary differential equations is discontinuous along some threshold, solutions can be found that are continuous, if sometimes multivalued. We show the extent to which unique solutions can be found in general cases when the threshold takes the form of finitely many intersecting manifolds. If the intersections are transversal, finitely many solutions can be found that slide along the threshold. They are obtained by a hierarchical application of convex combinations to form a differential inclusion. The system chooses between these solutions by means of an instantaneous dummy system. No assumptions on attractivity are required, and all switches are treated equally, so the standard “Filippov” method is extended to intersections of discontinuity manifolds in the most natural way possible. The corresponding result in the setting of equivalent control is also given, allowing systems more general than typical linear control forms to be solved.},

abstract = {Using the theory of variable structure systems (VSSs), a geometric approach is presented for the analysis and design of control schemes in bilinear DC-to-DC switch-mode power supplies. A time scale separation property, which naturally describes desirable transient behavior of the power converter, is used to identify the slow manifold of the average system in which a stable sliding mode trajectory can be locally sustained. It is shown that the geometry associated with the sliding mode control is easy to understand and could be particularly exploited in circuits which are designed to exhibit a time scale separation property. It can be generally shown that sliding modes are locally exhibited on integral manifolds of average models of pulse-width-modulation schemes. Thus, VSS theory provides the designer with an alternative, systematic method of geometric nature for the specification of regulation loops in DC-to-DC power converters, which is equivalent to the traditional pulsewidth modulation design technique in terms of average behavior},

Sliding mode control extends the properties of hysteresis control to multi-variable environments, resulting in stability even for large supply and load variations, good dynamic response and simple implementation. Application to dc–dc converters, as well as rectifiers and inverters, is analyzed and provisions to overcome the inherent drawbacks of sliding mode control, i.e. variable switching frequency and possible steady-state errors, are described. Experimental results are also reported, which allow a comparison between the sliding mode approach and other standard control techniques, e.g. current-mode control, showing its effectiveness.},

Under these conditions, a parameterization of all controllers solving the problem is given as a linear fractional transformation (LFT) on a contractive, stable, free parameter. The state dimension of the coefficient matrix for the LFT, constructed using the two Riccati solutions, equals that of the plant and has a separation structure reminiscent of classical LQG (i.e. H 2) theory.

abstract = {This paper presents parameter optimization of the compensating circuit for the reduction of the DC ripple energy on a single-phase voltage source PWM rectifier. In the single-phase PWM rectifier, it is well known that a power pulsation with twice the utility frequency is contained in the output power. In a conventional PWM rectifier, electrolytic capacitors with large capacitance have been used in order to smooth the DC voltage. However, lifetime of those capacitors is shortened by the power pulsation with twice utility frequency. The authors have been studied two kinds of DC ripple compensation circuits, such the authors call an inductive storage method and a capacitive storage method, those enable to transfer the ripple energy appeared on the output DC capacitors into the energy in an additional inductor and additional small capacitors. Hence, extension of the lifetime of the converter can be expected because the small film capacitor substitutes for the large electrolytic capacitors. Moreover, the inductance and capacitance region in which the DC ripple energy can be compensated completely and the overall dimensions of the energy storage devices are shown. Finally, experimental results of compensation characteristics on both the steady state and transient state are discussed.},

abstract = {The development of trajectory sensitivity analysis for hybrid systems, such as power systems, is presented in the paper. A hybrid system model which has a differential-algebraic-discrete (DAD) structure is proposed. This model forms the basis for the subsequent sensitivity analysis. Crucial to the analysis is the development of jump conditions describing the behavior of sensitivities at discrete events, such as switching and state resetting. The efficient computation of sensitivities is discussed. A number of examples are presented to illustrate various aspects of the theory. It is shown that trajectory sensitivities provide insights into system behavior which cannot be obtained from traditional simulation},

abstract = {Inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically poorly controllable by means of local decentralized control. Recent research efforts have been aimed at developing wide-area control strategies that involve communication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area control, the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria. In contrast, here we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity-promoting optimal control to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed-loop performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an {\$}ell{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\$} -penalty on the feedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only making use of a single wide-area communication link. In addition to this nominal performance, we also demonstrate that our control strategy yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means.},

abstract = {Switched power converters are used to interface the dc output in modern distributed power generation systems, which are usually aggregated to the main grid to yield the necessary power using interconnected modules. Synthesis, modeling, and stability analysis of interconnected systems using cascaded converters working under sliding-mode control are considered in this paper. A systematic procedure to synthesize cascaded connection of dc-dc boost converters is introduced. The approach is based on making each module to behave as a suitable canonical element for power processing. Three different elements are considered, which are the dc power gyrator, the dc transformer, and the dc loss-free resistor. These canonical elements are designed by means of a sliding-mode control theory and then their dynamic behavior is studied in detail. The sliding-mode conditions for each case are derived in closed form to obtain design-oriented criteria for selecting the parameters of the system. The aforementioned canonical elements are compared to select the most suitable one for a distributed power system. Simulation results ensure the correctness of the proposed approach. Experimental measurements corroborate the theoretical predictions and the numerical simulations.},

Dynamic modeling of the ZSC from different perspectives has been studied. Based on these models, the dc-link voltage is controlled using direct measurement or measurement of the capacitor voltage. In this paper, two methods of dc-link voltage control of ZSC are analyzed and compared. Both methods are based on measuring the input voltage and the capacitor voltage to estimate the peak of the dc link voltage. Compensator for both voltage mode (VM) and current programmed mode (CPM) controls were designed based on the state space averaged signal model of the ZSC with inductive loading. In CPM, since the order of the system is reduced by one, it is possible to achieve similar dynamic performance with a simpler compensator. Performance of both control methods of the compensated ZSC are verified by simulation and experimental results for input and load disturbances.},

A typical three-phase inverter can not supply output voltages greater than the voltages at its input; at the same manner, a typical three-phase boost-rectifier can not supply output voltages lower than input voltages. Using Z-source topology permits to overcome both these limits. In fact, a Z-source boost-rectifier can theoretically step-down the output voltage to any desired value. Additionally, it presents intrinsic immunity to shoot-through states, relaying to improved reliability of the entire system. In this paper, attention is focused on the mathematical modeling of a three-phase Z-source boost-rectifier for PFC power supply applications; where, using of such a topology as first-stage converter allows to design the second-stage converters with the same voltage constraints of single-phase units.},

A controlled DC-DC converter was used as the main bidirectional energy transfer enabler between the two buses. The focus of this paper is on how to achieve the best controllability and performance levels of the bidirectional converter when it is linking a DC bus with a relatively high voltage ripple to another with small ripple. The operating fundamentals of a buck-boost converter and its current control algorithm are explained. Different operation and control schemes are also presented. An experimental test setup was devised to investigate and compare the performance of each configuration. A three-phase full wave diode rectifier was used to achieve the high voltage ripple bus, whereas a three-phase controllable IGBT based rectifier was used as a pure DC bus. The results of the various experiments run for bidirectional power flow show that depending on the configuration of the system, better controllability and lower current ripple can be achieved by the proper selection of current and feedback.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present an analytical optimization approach of a flyback structure in PFC mode. Indeed, softwares like Saber, Pspice or Simplorer are effective means for the power electronics structure time-domain studies. However, if these structures have an AC input and a high switching frequency (various time scales), time-domain simulation becomes painful and expensive in memory and computing time. The study of EMC performances is also difficult because of the line impedance stabilizer network (LISN) time-constants which comes to penalize the time-domain simulation. In addition, in sizing and optimization process, results in short computing times are needed, so the time-domain simulation may be too time consuming. In this way, the paper proposes to carry out a compromise between the model accuracy and the tool rapidness and recommends the use of analytical models to optimize the passive element volume of a flyback structure by respecting EMC standards, by minimizing the whole losses dissipated in the structure (conduction and switching semiconductor losses, core and copper losses in the transformer) and by constraining the semiconductor junction, the winding and the magnetic circuit temperatures. Firstly, analytical models of the flyback structure for these various optimization aspects are developed, validated by numerical simulation or measures and integrated in an optimization process. Then, the optimization results are presented and validated thanks to a measurement workbench of the flyback structure.},

A GSIP problem is characterized by an infinite number of inequality constraints, and the corresponding index set depends additionally on the decision variables. There exist a wide range of applications which give rise to GSIP models; some of them are discussed in the present paper. Furthermore, geometric and topological properties of the feasible set and, in particular, the difference to the standard semi-infinite case are analyzed. By using first-order approximations of the feasible set corresponding constraint qualifications are developed. Then, necessary and sufficient first- and second-order optimality conditions are presented where directional differentiability properties of the optimal value function of the so-called lower level problem are used. Finally, an overview of numerical methods is given.},

The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been verified by means of computer simulations and it has also been experimentally implemented on a laboratory prototype with excellent results in both, stabilization and trajectory tracking tasks.},

Many levels or steps can follow a voltage reference with accuracy, and with the advantage that the generated voltage can be modulated in amplitude instead of pulse-width modulation. The main disadvantage of this type of topology is the large number of power supplies and semiconductors required to obtain these multistep voltage waveforms. This paper is focussed on minimizing the number of power supplies and semiconductors for a given number of levels. Different combinations of topologies are presented, and the corresponding mathematical relations have been derived. This paper shows optimized curves to obtain the relation between a minimum number of power semiconductors required for a given number of levels. Experimental results obtained from an optimized prototype, capable of generatng 81 levels of voltage with only four power supplies and 16 transistors per phase, are shown.},

abstract = {AC-DC power factor corrector circuits used in low-power applications have to overcome important power quality problems related to crest and power factors as well as total harmonic distortion (THD), and in many cases, they have to exhibit a high degree of output regulation. The design of efficient drivers for low-power applications using high-order converters is considered in this paper. Power factor correction is achieved by imposing a loss-free resistor behavior to SEPIC and Ćuk converters by means of an internal loop based on sliding-mode control, which requires a hysteretic comparator for its implementation. However, with a constant hysteresis width, the system exhibits harmful harmonic distortion in the input line current waveform so that a variable hysteresis window is used instead to avoid this distortion near the zero crossings of the input current. The subsequent analysis of the ideal sliding dynamics around the equilibrium point allows the design of an outer control loop to regulate the output current. Mathematical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed technique obtaining a significant improvement in terms of decreasing the THD. A dimmable LEDs driver supplying an HBLEDs string with a wide range of output current regulation illustrates the design.},

In case of two unbalanced inductors, many control techniques can produce different inductor current ripples during each half-line cycle that can result in the addition of a dc component to the line current. This paper demonstrates that the application of sliding-mode control by means of hysteretic controllers results in a first-order stable system that can mitigate these harmful consequences due to its capability to ensure the symmetry of the line input current waveform for both positive and negative half-line cycles. Thus, the system does not absorb any dc component from the grid and it is also capable of reducing dramatically the amplitude of the third harmonic. The theoretical predictions have been validated by means of PSIM simulations and experimentally on a prototype of 1 kW which has been controlled using only one sliding control surface.},

On the basis of this unified voltage vector, a close- loop unified control technique is proposed from the viewpoint of global inverter operation, which can improve the stability of the inverter system, keep the minimum voltage stress across the switches with variable input voltage, and implement the linear control of the output voltage. In addition, only the output voltage needs to be sensed in the unified control technique, unlike the traditional control methods that use both the output and capacitor voltages. This control method is also simple and easy implementation for digital control. Furthermore, various conventional voltage-source inverters (VSI) SVPWM control strategies (include internal current control) can be applied to the unified control technique. The feasibility of the proposed control method has been verified by the simulation and experimental results.},

The new converter structure is designed in such a way that, the modularity is available not only for voltage but also for current ratings, using the available devices. The new converter will be applicable for a wide range of medium voltage applications and using its modularity it also can be scaled up for high voltage applications. The proposed-converter control is described and the overall operation is explained through simulation. A simple active-reactive power control is utilized for the converter control. It has been highlighted, through simulation, that the proposed converter has a high degree of design flexibility introduced by its high number of redundant switching states. These redundancies are implemented for controlling the capacitor voltages of the converter modules. More importantly, they provide the converter with a DC and AC sides fault-handling capability; a function that is essential for an MV converter. It is explicitly shown that the converter can provide ancillary services to the grid during DC faults.},

Further the ripples in the output voltage are controlled by the principle of energy balance. Whenever the energy stored in the output capacitor goes below a threshold value, additional energy is drawn from the source and transferred to it according to requirements.

abstract = {Switched systems constitute an important modeling paradigm faithfully describing many engineering systems in which software interacts with the physical world. Despite considerable progress on stability and stabilization of switched systems, the constant evolution of technology demands that we make similar progress with respect to different, and perhaps more complex, objectives. This paper describes one particular approach to address these different objectives based on the construction of approximately equivalent (bisimilar) symbolic models for switched systems. The main contribution of this paper consists in showing that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental stability of a switched system (i.e., existence of a common Lyapunov function, or multiple Lyapunov functions with dwell time), it is possible to construct a finite symbolic model that is approximately bisimilar to the original switched system with a precision that can be chosen a priori. To support the computational merits of the proposed approach, we use symbolic models to synthesize controllers for two examples of switched systems, including the boost dc-dc converter.},

It has buck and boost function that cannot be achieved by traditional voltage-source inverters and current-source inverters. In the proposed four trans-Z-source inverters, all the impedance networks consist of a transformer and one capacitor. While maintaining the main features of the previously presented Z-source network, the new networks exhibit some unique advantages, such as the increased voltage gain and reduced voltage stress in the voltage-fed trans-ZSIs and the expanded motoring operation range in the current-fed trans-ZSIs, when the turns ratio of the transformer windings is over 1.

abstract = {The paper discusses the possibility of lowering a system sensitivity by the application of a sliding mode. The sliding mode can be obtained by means of control functions which on certain hypersurfaces have first order discontinuities in a state space. Such functions can be realized with comparatively simple elements. If it is possible to satisfy some conditions dependent on matrices which define the entering control and disturbance points to the system, and on the choice of subspaces in which the sliding mode predominates, the sliding mode motion will depend on the disturbances and variable parameters only through the initial conditions; that is, it will depend on the values of these quantities only until the sliding mode begins. Then whatever further values the disturbances might take will have no influence on the system behaviour as long as the sliding mode lasts. If the preliminary part, lasting until the sliding mode begins, is shortened by suitable control functions, a low sensitivity system can be obtained.

abstract = {Single-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifiers suffer from ripple power pulsating at twice the line frequency. The ripple power is usually filtered by a bulky capacitor bank or an LC branch, resulting in lower power density. The alternative way is active power decoupling, which uses an active circuit to direct the pulsating power into another energy-storage component. The main dc-link filter capacitor can, therefore, be reduced substantially. This paper proposed a new scheme of active power decoupling. The circuit consists of a third leg, an energy-storage capacitor and a smoothing inductor. The topology combined the advantages of high energy-storage efficiency and low requirement on control bandwidth. Both the pulsating power from the ac source and the reactive power of the smoothing inductors are taken into consideration when deriving the power decoupling scheme. The active power filter's (APF) capacitor voltage control system consists of inner loop pole-placement control and outer loop proportional-resonant control. To enhance the steady-state performance, the capacitor voltage reference is modified in a closed-loop manner. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed APF scheme has good power decoupling performance and is more suited for high-power applications where switching frequency is limited.},

It has the same circuit complexity as standard current-mode controllers, but provides extreme robustness and speed of response against supply, load, and parameter variations. Moreover, contrary to other sliding-mode techniques, the proposed solution features constant switching frequency in the steady state, synchronization to external triggers, and absence of steady-state errors in the output voltage},

The limitations of the traditional indirect sliding mode controller schemes are critically evaluated. These refer to the availability of the converter inductor current variable and a lack of robustness with respect to unmodelled load resistance variations. These limitations are overcome thanks to recent developments addressed as 'Generalized PI controllers' which are based on integral reconstructors of the unmeasured observable state variables and utilize only available input and output signals.},

abstract = {The direct control problem of matrix converters with input inductive capacitive (LC) filter using a new approach based on the sliding mode control technique is solved. This approach allows the design of the controller considering the converter and the dynamics of its associated LC filter. Together with the space vector representation technique, sliding mode allows the precise determination of switching times between the bi-directional switches, thus being appropriate to the nonlinear ON/OFF behaviour of the matrix converter power semiconductors. As the switching occurs just in time, this technique guarantees fast response times and precise control actions, ensuring that the output voltages and the input currents track their references and making input power factor regulation independent of the input filter parameters. This feature has special interest in applications requiring unity input power factor, when feeding AC drives, or applications needing variable and accurate input power factor regulation, usually related to power quality enhancement. The designed sliding mode controllers are tested and the obtained simulation and experimental results show that they ensure the direct control of matrix converters over a wide range of output frequencies, guaranteeing a leading or lagging input power factor regulation.},

@article{Jeffrey2014,
abstract = {Sharp switches in behaviour, like impacts, stick–slip motion, or electrical relays, can be modelled by differential equations with discontinuities. A discontinuity approximates fine details of a switching process that lie beyond a bulk empirical model. The theory of piecewise-smooth dynamics describes what happens assuming we can solve the system of equations across its discontinuity. What this typically neglects is that effects which are vanishingly small outside the discontinuity can have an arbitrarily large effect at the discontinuity itself. Here we show that such behaviour can be incorporated within the standard theory through nonlinear terms, and these introduce multiple sliding modes. We show that the nonlinear terms persist in more precise models, for example when the discontinuity is smoothed out. The nonlinear sliding can be eliminated, however, if the model contains an irremovable level of unknown error, which provides a criterion for systems to obey the standard Filippov laws for sliding dynamics at a discontinuity.},

At single-phase line voltage the power is pulsating with twice the line frequency. This power pulsation is generally eliminated by a passive short-circuit link placed in the DC link of the traction drive. The paper presents a possibility to exchange the passive short-circuit link for an active filter. The active filter enables operation at both 16 2/3 Hz and 50 Hz supply frequency. This is especially attractive for two frequency locomotives. Principle rules of design and control as well as important parameters for the design of the active filter are described.

abstract = {Spatial oscillations in neutron flux distribution resulting from xenon reactivity feedback are a matter of concern in large nuclear reactors. If the spatial oscillations in power distribution are not controlled, power density and rate of change of power at some locations in the reactor core may exceed their respective limits causing increase in chances of fuel failure. Hence, during the design stages of any large nuclear reactor, it is essential to identify the existence of spatial instabilities and to design suitable control strategy for regulating the spatial power distribution. This paper presents a method to design and analyze the effect of sliding mode control (SMC) for spatial control of Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). The AHWR model considered here is of 90th order with 5 inputs and 18 outputs. In this paper, numerically ill-conditioned system of AHWR is separated into 73rd order `slow' subsystem and 17th order `fast' subsystem and SMC is designed from slow subsystem. Further, using simple linear transformation matrices, SMC for full system is constructed. Also, it is proved that slow subsystem SMC results in a sliding mode motion for full system. Dynamic simulations has been carried out using nodal core model of AHWR to show effectiveness and robustness of proposed method.},

Two such strategies have been discussed and some modifications in their control tasks have been proposed to achieve more reliable and improved performance. In general, the multiband concept has been used while making the proposals. The hysteresis band size considerations have also been presented by taking into account the desired and existing system conditions. The proposed modulation schemes have been applied to a five-level flying-capacitor inverter, whose operation under hysteresis current control mode is much less established. A new method of flying-capacitor voltage balancing is proposed which ensures balanced flying-capacitor voltages and, at the same time, maintains the desired current profile. It uses a time-based approach for controlling the capacitor voltages and achieves appreciable voltage spectrum under wide range of load power factor conditions. The performance of the proposed strategies is confirmed through both simulation and experimental investigations.},

In order to maintain its robust output voltage regulation, the proposed controller adopts a simplified parallel-damped passivity-based controller (PD-PBC). A complementary proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller to the PD-PBC has been designed for removing the steady state error owing to the parasitic resistance. We present sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the augmented system with an additional dynamic system.

abstract = {Conventional multi-kW three-phase power converters (e.g. 380 V output) based on silicon (Si) devices (e.g. IGBTs) typically operate at switching frequencies of 50 kHz or less. By contrast, silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs are capable of switching at frequencies of up to several hundreds of kHz while still maintaining high efficiency operation. This opens up opportunities for greater system design optimisation, such as determining the smallest possible power converter volume and weight. Of particular interest is how the switching frequency affects the size of the passive components (e.g. heatsink, line filter, dc-link capacitor and EMI filter) which account for around 70-80{\%} of the power converter's volume and weight. This paper presents a set of models that outline the effect that changing the switching frequency has on the design of a 2-level, 3-phase inverter using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs as the active switches. In particular it will focus on the effect of the switching frequency on the design of the passive components.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe an approach to the analysis and design of power grid dynamic performance based on hybrid systems theory. Power grid is a large-scale cyber-physical system for transmission of electrical energy. The joint dynamics of physical processes and cyber elements in power grids are typical of a mixture of continuous and discrete behaviors, that is, hybrid dynamics. We address problems on stability that are basic concerns in the performance of current and future power grids with the hybrid dynamics. Measures for stability of power grids are interpreted as safety specifications in hybrid system models and are translated into restrictions on the systems' reachable sets of states. Algorithmic reachability analysis of hybrid systems enables analysis of safe initial states and hence quantitative estimation of stability regions. Also it contributes to synthesis of safe initial states as well as switching conditions in order to satisfy safety specifications in a power grid. We demonstrate the approach for two problems on transient stability of the single machine/infinite bus (SMIB) system and on fault release control of a multimachine power grid.},

This approach, based on space-vector notation, simplifies the study of the modulation strategies, leading to a complete general solution of the problem and providing a very useful unitary point of view. The already established strategies can be considered as particular cases of the proposed general solution. Using this approach, it can be verified that the space-vector modulation technique, owing to the intrinsic two degrees of freedom, represents the general solution of the modulation problem of matrix converters. This technique can be considered the best solution for the possibility to achieve the highest voltage transfer ratio and to optimize the switching pattern through a suitable use of the zero configurations},

abstract = {The possible operating states of an impedance network of a Z-source inverter are identified and analyzed with the objective of deriving design guidelines. Through the analysis it is shown that in addition to the desired three dynamic states, the operating cycle can contain another three static states that do not contribute to the power conversion process. These three static states can be avoided by selecting suitably large capacitors and inductors. By using the equations derived in the analysis of steady states, the paper presents guidelines to design the impedance network accurately for the case where the inverter is operated only in active and shoot-through states. Furthermore, a much simpler method is also presented to design the impedance network for the cases where the waveforms can be assumed to be linear. Computer simulations are used to verify the design process and to demonstrate the appearance of undesired states when sufficiently large capacitors and inductors are not selected},

The supervisory control algorithm and hardware implementation are described and projected long-term benefits of the proposed system are assessed by simulation. A representative dynamic model of the overall system, incorporating realistic wind-speed and load-power variations has been developed. An analysis is presented of the potential improvement in battery lifetime that is achievable by diverting short-term charge/discharge cycles to a supercapacitor energy-storage system. This study introduces a method by which supercapacitor energy storage systems and control algorithms can be evaluated and implemented in the application area considered. The composition of a prototype test system is described and experimental results are presented to demonstrate system feasibility.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of signal quantization and velocity estimation on the quality of the discrete-time sliding mode (DSM) in a positional servo-system. Velocity estimation is based on a simple backward finite difference method using the measured quantizied discrete-time position samples. It is shown that such introduced and amplified measurement noise degrades sliding motion into the quasi-sliding mode and threatens to provoke chattering. Furthermore, a DSM control algorithm is proposed, which provides satisfactory performance under these conditions. To avoid chattering, system trajectories are slowed down near the sliding surface by dividing the state space into the fast and slow convergence zones. In the slow zone an additional integral action is employed to secure convergence under action of disturbances. The proposed DSM controller has been experimentally tested in an induction motor position control.},

abstract = {It is well known that single-phase pulse width modulation rectifiers have second-order harmonic currents and corresponding ripple voltages on the dc bus. The low-frequency harmonic current is normally filtered using a bulk capacitor in the bus, which results in low power density. However, pursuing high power density in converter design is a very important goal in the aerospace applications. This paper studies methods for reducing the energy storage capacitor for single-phase rectifiers. The minimum ripple energy storage requirement is derived independently of a specific topology. Based on the minimum ripple energy requirement, the feasibility of the active capacitor's reduction schemes is verified. Then, we propose a bidirectional buck-boost converter as the ripple energy storage circuit, which can effectively reduce the energy storage capacitance. The analysis and design are validated by simulation and experimental results.},

abstract = {The integration of photovoltaic (PV) modules in buildings causes problems with shadows that can strongly reduce the energy produced by these systems. Moreover, most PV modules are designed for stand-alone applications that have output voltage adapted to lead batteries. Indeed, this historical sizing of PV modules can be discussed in the case of grid-connected systems. In this paper, a cascaded dc/dc converter based on boost chopper is proposed. First, the advantages and the limits of this topology will be shown. Second, this topology will be optimized to maximize the efficiency or minimize the volume. The originality of this optimization is that the converters' parameters and the arrangement of the PV cells are variable parameters. Indeed, the optimization is done on the entire system. To realize these optimizations, semiempiric models of losses and volumes of different components of a boost chopper were developed. The optimization uses a successive quadratic programming algorithm. Considering the optimization results over the whole range of the specifications, a flexible solution is developed and experimental results are presented. Finally, optimized topologies connected to several PV are evaluated at different situations of typical shadows.},

abstract = {Multilevel inverter technology has emerged recently as a very important alternative in the area of high-power medium-voltage energy control. This paper presents the most important topologies like diode-clamped inverter (neutral-point clamped), capacitor-clamped (flying capacitor), and cascaded multicell with separate DC sources. Emerging topologies like asymmetric hybrid cells and soft-switched multilevel inverters are also discussed. This paper also presents the most relevant control and modulation methods developed for this family of converters: multilevel sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation, multilevel selective harmonic elimination, and space-vector modulation. Special attention is dedicated to the latest and more relevant applications of these converters such as laminators, conveyor belts, and unified power-flow controllers. The need of an active front end at the input side for those inverters supplying regenerative loads is also discussed, and the circuit topology options are also presented. Finally, the peripherally developing areas such as high-voltage high-power devices and optical sensors and other opportunities for future development are addressed.},

abstract = {A major disadvantage of applying sliding mode control to dc/dc converters is that the steady-state switching frequency is affected by line and load variations. This is undesirable as it complicates the design of the input and output filters. To reduce switching frequency deviation in the events of line and load variations, an adaptive feedforward control scheme that varies the hysteresis band according to the change of line input voltage and an adaptive feedback control scheme that varies the control parameter (i.e., sliding coefficient) according to the change of the output load are proposed. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. In addition, methods of implementing the proposed adaptive control strategies are discussed. Experimental results confirm that the adaptive control schemes are capable of reducing the switching frequency variations caused by both line and load variations.},

The original single-stage Z-source inverter incorporates a unique passive impedance network coupled between the inverter main circuit and power source, thus overcoming some conceptual limitations of conventional voltage-fed and current-fed inverters. The proposed isolated Z-source inverters carefully integrate the Z-source network concept into the two-stage DC-DC-AC topology, by employing high frequency transformers. While inheriting the great merits of original Z-source inverters, such as wide input range, buck and boost functions, and high reliability against EMI noises, the proposed topologies can achieve input-output isolation and higher voltage boost ratio with reduced device stresses, with transformer secondary to primary turns ratio over 1. This paper concentrates on one example of a voltage-fed isolated Z-source inverter to elaborate the detailed operating principle and control.

@article{Konig2014,
abstract = {Battery emulation with a controllable high-power dc supply enables repeatable hardware-in-the-loop testing of powertrains for hybrid and electric vehicles. For this purpose, not only the power flow but also the nonlinear characteristic and dynamic impedance of batteries need to be emulated. In this paper, nonlinear local model networks are used to obtain dynamic battery models with high fidelity that can be computed in real time. This approach also allows the extraction of local linear impedance models for high-bandwidth impedance emulation, leading to a tighter coupling between the test bed and simulation model with predictable closed-loop dynamics. A model predictive controller that achieves optimal control with adherence to system constraints is extended to impedance control and robustness against constant power loads. This results not only in superior dynamic performance but also in stable dc-bus voltage control even for testing of tightly controlled electric motor inverters with negative differential input resistance. Since the controller design is based on a model of the test bed setup including the virtual battery model, emulator hardware, and input characteristics of the powertrain under test, it is possible to systematically analyze stability.},

However, it has the drawback of wide variation in switching frequency, and usually requires an oversized filter to remove unwanted signals. This situation becomes more severe when BC is applied to DC-AC inverters that have a time-varying reference. In this paper, we provide a thorough study into this problem, and propose an enhanced BC method to restrict the variation of the switching frequency of DC-AC inverters. Based on the ripple information of the state variables, a BC method with ripple-derived switching surface is developed and implemented in the inverter. Experimental results show that the proposed control method is capable of limiting the switching frequency variation while maintaining the characteristics of fast dynamical response and accurate steady-state regulation.},

The theory reveals a two-level intertwined cellular nature of the constrained system dynamics which serves as a unifying structure, a taxonomy, for analyzing nonlinear phenomena in large system models. These broadly divide into the state space aspects (related to dynamic stability issues among others) and the parameter space aspects (connected with bifurcation phenomena among others). In the state-space formulation, the boundary of the region of attraction for the operating point is shown (under certain Morse-Smale like assumptions) to be composed of stable manifolds of certain anchors and portions of the singularity surface. Such boundary characterization provides the foundation for rigorous Lyapunov theoretic transient stability methods. In the parameter space analysis, the feasibility region which is bounded by the feasibility boundary provides a safe opening region for guaranteeing local stability at the equilibrium under slow parametric variations. The feasibility boundary where the operating point undergoes loss of local stability is characterized in the form of three principal bifurcations including a new bifurcation called the singularity induced bifurcation},

abstract = {Multilevel power converters that provide more than two levels of voltage to achieve smoother and less distorted AC-to-DC, DC-to-AC, and DC-to-DC power conversion, have attracted many contributors. This paper presents a generalized multilevel inverter (converter) topology with self voltage balancing. The existing multilevel inverters such as diode-clamped and capacitor-clamped multilevel inverters can be derived from the generalized inverter topology. Moreover, the generalized multilevel inverter topology provides a true multilevel structure that can balance each DC voltage level automatically without any assistance from other circuits, thus, in principle, providing a complete and true multilevel topology that embraces the existing multilevel inverters. From this generalized multilevel inverter topology, several new multilevel inverter structures can be derived. Some application examples of the generalized multilevel converter are given},

This method tracks system efficiency, which is dc-dc converter efficiency in this paper, and adaptively optimizes system parameters to maximize efficiency. The MEPT method is used in this paper to optimize the primary-to-secondary switches' dead-time parameter in an isolated topology to reduce the switches' body diodes conduction during commutation periods and to reduce body diodes conduction and reverse-recovery related losses in order to improve efficiency. MEPT tracks converter efficiency while changing the dead-time and detects the optimized dead-time value at the maximum efficiency point at different load and line conditions. In this paper, the MEPT method is discussed and analyzed, and its digital control algorithm and experimental implementation are presented},

One of the main issues to be tackled in simulating human intelligence and reasoning is how to represent human knowledge in a computing system. In this paper, two main approaches are discussed: the formalization of a sequence of reasoning rules (the expert system approach) and the collection of a set of input-output instructions describing human experience but not the internal mechanisms leading to the decision (the neural network approach). The adoption of a Sugeno fuzzy model for supporting the decision-making processes in a company is proposed, and a case of application is presented for testing the performance of such a model and discussing the organizational implications of fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches},

abstract = {This paper presents an active topology for power decoupling in single-phase ac-dc converters, featuring the effective suppression of low-frequency power ripple which is an inherent problem in single-phase energy conversion systems. This topology is composed of an H-bridge circuit and a ripple power-decoupling circuit. The ripple power-decoupling circuit shares one bridge arm with the H-bridge circuit so it has less additional components: just one IGBT, one diode, and an energy-storage inductor. Its modulation strategy is properly devised to coordinate the operation of decoupling circuit and H-bridge circuit. To enhance the power-decoupling performance, a direct ripple power-cancellation method based on energy-storage inductor is proposed. A multiresonant controller with feed-forward control is introduced for fast and precise current tracking. The effectiveness of this topology has been verified by detailed simulation studies as well as the laboratory prototype experiment results.},

They use a unique $\Gamma$-shaped impedance network for boosting their output voltage in addition to their usual voltage-buck behavior. Comparing them with other topologies, the proposed inverters use lesser components and a coupled transformer for producing the high-gain and modulation ratio simultaneously. The obtained gain can be tuned by varying the turns ratio $\gamma$$\Gamma$Z of the transformer within the narrow range of 1 {\textless}; $\gamma$$\Gamma$Z ≤ 2. This leads to lesser winding turns at high gain, as compared to other related topologies. Experimental testing has already proven the validity of the proposed inverters.},

Control and modeling methods are discussed. A list of VSC-based HVdc installations worldwide is included. It is confirmed that the continuous development of power electronics presents cost-effective opportunities for the utilities to exploit, and HVdc remains a key technology. In particular, VSC-HVdc can address not only conventional network issues such as bulk power transmission, asynchronous network interconnections, back-to-back ac system linking, and voltage/stability support to mention a few, but also niche markets such as the integration of large-scale renewable energy sources with the grid and most recently large onshore/offshore wind farms.},

Both topologies are able to achieve Zero Current Switching (ZCS) in the HV side switches, reducing the switching losses in these devices, which contribute to a large share to the system losses. Efficiency curves are presented for different semiconductor technologies for the Low-Voltage (LV) side switch in order to study the trade-offs between the selected topologies.

abstract = {There is a growing interest on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV's) due to energy security and green house gas emission issues, as well as the low electricity fuel cost. As battery capacity and all-electric range of PHEV's are improved, and potentially some PHEV's or EV's need fast charging, there is increased demand to build high power off-board charging infrastructures. A charge station architecture for municipal parking decks has been proposed, which has a DC microgrid to interface with multiple DC-DC chargers, distributed renewable power generations and energy storage, and provides functionalities of normal and rapid charging, grid support such as reactive and real power injection (including V2G), current harmonic filtering and load balance. Several non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters suited for charge station applications have been reviewed and compared, as the major focus of this paper. Half bridge converter is a good candidate but it is difficult to maintain high efficiency in wide battery pack voltage range. A variable frequency pulse width modulation (VFPWM) scheme is proposed to mitigate this issue. Finally three-level bi-directional DC-DC converter is suggested to be employed in this application. A 10kW prototype verifies that 95.1-97.9{\%} full load efficiency can be achieved in charging mode with 180-360V battery pack voltage. In addition, the inductor size is only one third of the half bridge counterpart, which is a great advantage for high power converters.},

abstract = {Multilevel voltage source converters are emerging as a new breed of power converter options for high-power applications. The multilevel voltage source converters typically synthesize the staircase voltage wave from several levels of DC capacitor voltages. One of the major limitations of the multilevel converters is the voltage unbalance between different levels. The techniques to balance the voltage between different levels normally involve voltage clamping or capacitor charge control. There are several ways of implementing voltage balance in multilevel converters. Without considering the traditional magnetic coupled converters, this paper presents three recently developed multilevel voltage source converters: (1) diode-clamp, (2) flying-capacitors, and (3) cascaded-inverters with separate DC sources. The operating principle, features, constraints, and potential applications of these converters are discussed},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and compares the performance of linear, decoupled and direct power controllers (DPC) for three-phase matrix converters operating as unified power flow controllers (UPFC). A simplified steady-state model of the matrix converter-based UPFC fitted with a modified Venturini high-frequency pulse width modulator is first used to design the linear controllers for the transmission line active (P) and reactive (Q) powers. In order to minimize the resulting cross coupling between P and Q power controllers, decoupled linear controllers (DLC) are synthesized using inverse dynamics linearization. DPC are then developed using sliding-mode control techniques, in order to guarantee both robustness and decoupled control. The designed P and Q power controllers are compared using simulations and experimental results. Linear controllers show acceptable steady-state behavior but still exhibit coupling between P and Q powers in transient operation. DLC are free from cross coupling but are parameter sensitive. Results obtained by DPC show decoupled power control with zero error tracking and faster responses with no overshoot and no steady-state error. All the designed controllers were implemented using the same digital signal processing hardware.},

abstract = {Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability in the large of pulse-modulated feedback systems are developed from the operator theoretic viewpoint. Stability here requires that the pulse-modulated feedback system be a Lipschitz continuous operator on the extended space{\textless}tex{\textgreater}L{\_}{\{}1e{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}. This strong definition of stability is motivated by an examination of a first-order pulsewidth-modulated system. To provide a unified format for the main development two distinct general classes of pulse modulators are defined. Type I includes the pulsewidth modulator and more general pulsewidth frequency modulators that contain a sampler. Type II includes, for example, the integral pulse frequency modulator and its generalizations. For elements of Type I conditions are derived to bound the incremental gain (on{\textless}tex{\textgreater}L{\_}{\{}1e{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}) of the modulator in cascade with a linear element; a standard transformation of the feedback loop similar to that used in the derivation of the Popov criterion yields sufficient conditions for stability of the feedback system in the above strong sense. Type II modulators are discontinuous on any normed linear space and thus, only conditions for boundedness of the closed-loop system as an operator on L{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}are given for this case.},

abstract = {Reduced matrix converter (RMC) is a convenient topology for offshore wind farm due to its potential to reduce the size and weight of the converter, to improve the reliability by removing the electrolytic capacitor, and to increase the efficiency inherent to less stages of conversion. Moreover, it is a very flexible topology which permits different types of operation with a simpler modulation compared with conventional three-phase matrix converter. This paper investigates different modulation strategies applied to RMC for offshore wind farms, focused on efficiency improvement of the entire convention system. Simulation results using a detailed loss model for high-power level are presented. Four cases are investigated according to the modulation strategies (space vector modulation and carrier-based modulation) and the operation principle (current source converter or voltage source converter). Losses in the clamp circuit are also calculated. Different wind velocities are considered in the simulations. Results show that current source operation with space vector modulation presents minimum losses at nominal wind velocity. This operation is suitable for series connection of offshore wind farms which has been reported as the most efficient alternative from the grid losses point of view.},

The sliding curve of the sliding-mode controller is designed such that the behavior of the controlled PWM inverter is optimal subject to the selected cost function.

In this regard, Sliding Mode Control (S.M.C.) is utilized. To decrease energy consumption, arising from chattering phenomenon, a smooth switch has been used in design procedure. Consequently, sliding equation will play a dominant controlling role in its neighborhood. The converging property of sliding motion towards the origin is a challenging issue. In this article we present a new method to prove the stability of the sliding phase which means, state trajectories on the sliding surface move toward the origin. At the beginning, the equivalent control method is reestablished such that makes this purpose accessible. The modification bounds the sliding equation to a converging set. Then to improve main factors of closed loop system, such as, transient behavior, energy consumption and the domain of attraction, the optimal control theory is used to compute the optimized sliding surface in the stabilizing set. Generally, desired surface has nonlinear terms. Finally, we propose an elaborate algorithm for computing optimized nonlinear surfaces. The designed controller is applied to a flexible-link setup.

A frequency-domain method is proposed for the determination of net hysteresis bandwidth for a given desired maximum switching frequency of the inverter. The switching transition concept of Tsypkin's method and the describing function of nonlinear relay have been used for the derivation of results. A hierarchical switching algorithm has been suggested for the modular cells of the cascaded multilevel inverter. The hierarchy of each cell is swapped sequentially to provide the self-balancing capability in case the dc-link voltage is supported by the capacitors. The simulation and experimental verification of the derived results are provided through a single-phase distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) model. The application in the three-phase system has been shown through simulation studies on a 3.3-kV distribution-system compensation using DSTATCOM. Verification on both single- and three-phase systems is obtained using a five-level cascaded-multilevel-inverter topology.},

@article{Lopez-Santos2015,
abstract = {A robust controller design to obtain output voltage regulation in a quadratic boost converter with high dc gain is discussed in this paper. The proposed controller has an inner loop based on sliding-mode control whose sliding surface is defined for the input inductor current. The current reference value of the sliding surface is modified by a proportional-integral compensator in an outer loop that operates over the output voltage error. The stability of the two-loop controller is proved by using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, which determines a region in the Kp-Ki plane, where the closed-loop system is always stable. The analysis of the sliding-mode-based control loop is performed by means of the equivalent control method, while the outer loop compensator is derived by means of the Nyquist-based Robust Loop Shaping approach with the M-constrained Integral Gain Maximization technique. Robustness is analyzed in depth taking into account the parameter variation related with the operation of the converter in different equilibrium points. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the approach for a 20-100-W quadratic boost converter stepping-up a low dc voltage (15-25-V dc) to a 400-V dc level.},

@article{Bode2003,
abstract = {Most multilevel inverter hysteresis current regulators use either multiple hysteresis bands, or a time-based switching logic that forces the current error back to zero by recursively stepping through successive voltage levels. Of these two alternatives, the time-based approach has the merit of only requiring simple analog circuitry and digital logic to implement the voltage level selection process for inverters of any number of voltage levels. However, the approach can be less stable and has a poorer dynamic response than a multiple hysteresis band system. This paper presents a double-band regulator that uses the slope of the current error to help determine the appropriate steady state voltage level to keep this error within the inner hysteresis band, while still allowing switching to the extreme inverter states during transient conditions to reduce the current error as rapidly as possible. The regulator achieves better stability and dynamic performance than previously reported schemes. The paper also presents an adaptation of the system to control a hybrid seven-level inverter. Theory, simulation, and experimental results are presented.},

@article{El-Sousy2013,
abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive dynamic sliding-mode control system (ADSMCS) with recurrent radial basis function network (RRBFN) for indirect field-orientation control induction motor (IM) drive is proposed. The ADSMCS comprises a dynamic sliding-mode controller (DSMC), an RRBFN uncertainty observer and a robust controller. The DSMC is proposed to reduce the chattering phenomenon. However, due to the uncertainty bound being unknown of the switching function for the DSMC, an ADSMCS is proposed to increase the robustness and improve the control performance of IM drive. In the ADSMCS, an RRBFN uncertainty observer is used to estimate an unknown nonlinear time-varying function of lumped parameter uncertainty online. Moreover, the adaptive learning algorithms for the RRBFN are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to train the parameters of the RRBFN online. Furthermore, a robust controller is proposed to confront the uncertainties including approximation error, optimal parameter vector and higher order term in Taylor series. A computer simulation and an experimental system are developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ADSMCS. All control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C31 DSP-based control computer. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the ADSMCS grants robust performance and precise response regardless of load disturbances and IM uncertainties.},

It compares five algorithms, including the linear design, with respect to their ease of design and their closed-loop performance. For all these algorithms local asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium is ensured. The motivation of the present study is not to illustrate the validity of these theoretical results, but to test their performance when confronted with a real physical application where situations not predicted by the theory will arise. The behavior of the schemes is compared with the following basic criteria: transient and steady state response to steps and sinusoidal references, attenuation of disturbances in the power supply, and sensitivity to unknown loads. Particular emphasis is placed throughout on the flexibility provided by the tuning parameters to shape the responses. Even though this issue is not always appreciated in theoretical studies, we have found it of prime importance in experimentation},

abstract = {Z-source neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter has recently been proposed as an alternative three-level buck-boost power conversion solution with an improved output waveform quality. In principle, the designed Z-source inverter functions by selectively "shooting through" its power sources, coupled to the inverter using two unique Z-source impedance networks, to boost the inverter three-level output waveform. Proper modulation of the new inverter would therefore require careful integration of the selective shoot-through process to the basic switching concepts to achieve maximal voltage-boost, minimal harmonic distortion, lower semiconductor stress and minimal number of device commutations per switching cycle. To date, the theoretical background on Z-source NPC modulation has not been fully established, and it is the theme of this paper to propose a number of enhanced voltage-boost pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies for controlling the Z-source NPC inverter. While developing the PWM techniques, attention has been devoted to carefully derive them from a common generic basis for improved portability, easier implementation, and most importantly, assisting readers in understanding all concepts that have been presented. The presented strategies are also comparatively evaluated to identify their individual advantages and disadvantages, which are subsequently summarized in a comprehensive reference table. Lastly, simulation and experimental results are included for validating the performances and practicalities of the presented modulation schemes},

However, there is currently a lack of efficient unified frameworks for optimising the system level design of converters in terms of the device, heatsink and passive component selection. This paper presents an efficient unified design optimisation framework that can be applied to a wide range of power converter design problems. The main advantage of the proposed framework is that it produces optimal solutions with great computational efficiency. The proposed framework was validated by applying to SiC-based converter design problems, achieving power densities of 8.32 kW/kg for a 50-kW DC-DC converter, and 3.50 kW/L for a 5-kW 3-phase DC-AC converter.},

Moreover, the error increases as the converter's switching frequency decreases. This paper presents an in-depth study of the phenomenon and offers a solution to the problem.

This paper shows that, in addition to the desired three dynamic states, an operating cycle can contain another three static states that do not contribute to the power conversion process. These three static states can be avoided by selecting suitably large capacitors and inductors. By using the equations derived in the steady-state analysis, this paper presents guidelines to design the impedance network accurately for the case where the inverter is operated only in active and shoot-through states. The proposed design method can also be used to predict the critical values of capacitance and inductance below which static states appear during the operating cycle. Computer simulations and laboratory experiments are used to verify the design method and to demonstrate the appearance of static states when the capacitors and inductors are sized lower than their critical values.},
